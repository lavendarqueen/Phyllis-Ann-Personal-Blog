# Phyllis-Ann-Personal-Blog

## Description

A personal blog page with light/dark mode and a back button that allows users to read and write blog posts through a user interface that collects the user's username, blog post title and their blog posts.

- Motivation: This type of page is a useful tool for communicating ideas and networking with others with similar interests.
- Why did you build this project? Building this blog page was an educational experience, both in learning how to code such a document, but also in learning about the benefits of having a blog page.
- What problem does it solve? My personal blog can connect me with other web developers when I have a problem I'm not sure how to resolve.
- What did you learn? I learned about blogging, as well as how to write JavaScript functions to insert html code into a document when a user posts a comment, and to manage styling on a Bootstrap framework.

## Installation

When a user opens the landing page, they find a user interface form to complete with their blog title, user name, and their blog comment. If they fail to complete all the items on the form before clicking on the submit button, they receive an alert instructing them to complete the form in order to post their comment. When the form is properly completed clicking on the submit button will bring them to the blog page where their blog post has been added to an array of blog posts, which they can read and respond to. Once on the blog page, a user can toggle from light mode to dark mode or click on the back button to leave another blog post.

## Usage

1. When the landing page has loaded, complete the form fields provided to enter your user name, blog title, and blog comment.

2. Click the submit button to post your comment and you will be directed to the blog page, where you can review your post and others.

3. Once you are directed to the blog page, you can select day or night mode by toggling the oval-shaped button in the header.

4. If you would like to leave another comment after reviewing the existing blog posts, click the back button at the top of the page and repeat these instuctions.
